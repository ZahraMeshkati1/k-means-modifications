# modification of k-means algorithm
The purpose of this research is to improve the performance of the k-means algorithm and introduce optimized versions.
five versions of this algorithm are introduced: 
- **(1) k-means algorithm**
- **(2) global k-means algorithm (GKM)**
 - **(3) fast global k-means algorithm**
 - **(4) modified fast gkm algorithm**
 - **(5) modified k-means algorithm**
The results and evaluations obtained from the optimized algorithms using real world datasets, are presented at the end of the description pdf.

# features
