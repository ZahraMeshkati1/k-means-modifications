# modification of k-means algorithm
The purpose of this research is to improve the performance of the k-means algorithm and introduce optimized versions.
five versions of this algorithm are introduced: 
(1) k-means algorithm, 
(2) global k-means algorithm (GKM) 
(3) fast global k-means algorithm
(4) modified fast gkm algorithm
(5) modified k-means algorithm.
The results obtained from the optimized algorithms are presented at the end of the description pdf.
